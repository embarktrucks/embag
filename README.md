# Embag: A really fast, simple bag file reader
[![embag CI status](https://github.com/embarktrucks/embag/workflows/pypi_build/badge.svg)](https://github.com/embarktrucks/embag/actions)
[![PyPI version](https://badge.fury.io/py/embag.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/py/embag)

This library reads [ROS](https://wiki.ros.org) [bag files](http://wiki.ros.org/Bags/Format/2.0) quickly without their [message descriptions](http://wiki.ros.org/msg) and without any dependencies.

## Building
First, you'll need [Bazel](https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/install-ubuntu.html#step-1-add-bazel-distribution-uri-as-a-package-source).
To build, run:

    # Embag echo demo binary
    bazel build //embag_echo:embag_echo
    # Run with
    bazel-bin/embag_echo/embag_echo --bag /path/to/sweet.bag --topic /awesome/topic

    # Shared object file
    bazel build //lib:libembag.so

    # Debian package
    bazel build //lib:embag-debian

    # Python Wheel (for example, you might use a specific installation of Python)
    PYTHON_BIN_PATH=/usr/local/bin/python3.7.5 bazel build //python:wheel
    
To test, run:

    # This will run both the C++ and Python tests against a small bag file
    bazel test test:* --test_output=all

## Usage
To use the C++ API:
```c++
Embag::View view{filename};
view.addBag("another.bag");  # Views support reading from multiple bags

for (const auto &message : view.getMessages({"/fun/topic", "/another/topic"})) {
  std::cout << message->timestamp.to_sec() << " : " << message->topic << std::endl;
  std::cout << message->data()["fun_array"][0]["fun_field"].as<std::string>() << std::endl;
}
```
There's also a Python API.  See the [python directory](https://github.com/embarktrucks/embag/tree/master/python) for details.
See the [tests](https://github.com/embarktrucks/embag/tree/master/test) for more usage examples.

## Benchmarks
These tests were performed on a 473M bag file compressed with lz4.  The bag contains a number of complex topics and each library was asked to print the topic, timestamp, and deserialized message.
Unfortunately, it's not possible to decode messages using the ROS C++ API without precompiled message definitions.
